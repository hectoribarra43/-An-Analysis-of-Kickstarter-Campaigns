# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project we will be helping and upcoming playwriter, Louise. She wants to start a crowdfunding for her play "Fever". We will be sorting, analyzing and organazing Excel data to determine wheter there are spécific factors that make a "campaign" succesful or not. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise and give her insights of succesful campaigns so she can take decsions and have also a succesfuly play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This time we are analyzing the "Theatre" category. We can note that on May we have a peak of succesfuly outcomes, with 111 sucessfuly outcomes. In october we can also see a peak of failed outcomes, 50 total. From March to May we can see a huge increase in sucessful outcomes.Furthetrmore on Decemeber we can determine that such as sucessful and failed outcomes are almost equal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We could see that the highest percentage of succesful plays (76%) are the ones that had a goal "Less that 1000".We can also note that the highest percentage failed plays (100%) are concentrated on the ones which goal is "Greater than 50000". On the other hand observing the data we can determine that there were none plays "canceled".

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

*In May is the best month to Launch a Thetre campaign and December the most inconvenient month to launch a Theatre campaign.

*The Thetre campaign during the whole year is barely canceled compared to the other outcomes. And we can see also during most of the year we have more succesful outcomes.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

*None of the plays were canceled no matter wich goal they had.

*The highest ´percentage of of successful plays are the ones which have a goal "Less than 1000".

*Analyzing the data we can determine that the lower the goal the greater percentage of succesful plays. So the greater the goal the percentage of failed outcomes will increase.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

*We can say the data wasn´t clean, so at first it wasn´t readable at all and we had to manage some formulas for better understanding.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

*A pie chart to see which is the most common prcaticed category.

*A bar chart to determine wich category or subcategory is the most succesul one.
